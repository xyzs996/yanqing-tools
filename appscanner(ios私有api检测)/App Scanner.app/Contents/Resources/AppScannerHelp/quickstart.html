						A. Apple review guidelines that cycle through.  Feel free to read them while your app is being scanned.
					</p>
					<p>
						B. A search bar that lets you look up method signatures.  Just start typing a signature and results will start to 
						appear.  Try typing in "streetview" without the quotes and see if iOS has Google street view embedded in it.
					</p>
					<p>
						C. The entire window acts like a drop box.  Drop your compiled (debug/simulator) .app file onto this window to start the scanning process.
					</p>
				</div>    
				<p>
					There are two primary ways that you can start using App Scanner, Search or Scan.
				</p> 	
				<h1>
					Searching:
				</h1>    
				<p>
					To use App Scanner as a search tool, launch the App Scanner app.  Type the method signature into box 'B' (see above sceenshot).  
					Results will appear in a table below the search bar (see below screenshot).  
					
					<img alt="search_results" src="search_results.png">
					
					<br />
					There are two columns here.  The first column is the likelihood.  It tells you how likely that result is to being a private API 
					method.  0% == not at all.  100% == YES, IT IS PRIVATE!
					<br/>  <br/>
					The second column shows the method signature.  Note that method signatures are condensed down and strip out the variable names.  
					i.e. a regular method that looks like:
					
					<div id="apps">
						-(void)thisIsMyExampleWithText:(NSString*)myText;
					</div>
					will look like
					<div id="apps">
						thisIsMyExampleWithText:
					</div>
					in App Scanner results.
				</p>
				<h1>
					Scanning:
				</h1>
				<p>
					The second way you can use App Scanner is to drop your compiled code into the App Scanner window and have it analyzed for 
					private API methods.  This is extremely useful for quickly checking open source code or code pilfered from the internet that 
					may be untrustworthy and contain private API methods.
				</p>
				<p>
					To initiate scanning, build your Xcode project for Simulator/Debug.  Find the resulting .app file.  Drag and drop that .app file 
					onto App Scanner.  App Scanner will present you with a progress bar and a fun little animation to keep you entertained while it 
					works.
				</p>
				<p>
					When App Scanner is finished analyzing your code it will display a results window.  The results window will list all the possible 
					matches that it found.  The most important item in the results window is the likelihood column (first column).  It tells you 
					whether or not the match is confirmed (100%) or a false positive (0%).       
				</p>
				<h3>
					Broadening the Scan:
				</h3>
				<p>
					You broaden or limit the scan by going to the preferences and setting the filter rate.  This is helpful if you only want to see 
					confirmed private signatures, or if you want to see additional results.  By default this value is set to 30%, meaning that only 
					results with a likelihood of 30% or higher are shown in the results table.
				</p>	
				<h1>
					Advanced Scanning (Command Line):
				</h1>
					Starting in version 1.4 of App Scanner, developers can integrate scanning into their build scripts via the command line.  The 
					command line version of App Scanner is integrated into the GUI version.
					<br/>
					<br/>
					Example Call:
					<div id="apps">
						./<i>pathtoAppScanner.app</i>/contents/macos/App\ Scanner -p <i>pathtoiOS.app</i> -v YES -l 50 -u YES
					</div>
					
					The flags accepted in the command line version are:
					<br/>
					<br/>
					<b>-p</b> Path (String):<br/>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Supply the path of the iOS.app that you'd like to scan.
					<br/>
					<br/>
					<b>-l</b> Likelihood (int 1-100):<br/>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The % cutoff for results.  -l 100 only returns method signatures that have a %100 likelihood of being private.
					<br/>
					<br/>
					<b>-v</b> Verbose (bool):<br/>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prints more of what is going on behind the scenes in App Scanner.  This is useful App Scanner doesn't appear to be working.
					<br/>
					<br/>
					<b>-u</b> Update (bool):<br/>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tells App Scanner to fetch the latest changes from the master server and update its local database before scanning your app.  This 
					flag is <b>highly</b> recommended on your first run on App Scanner if you haven't run the GUI version yet.  It will take an extra minute 
					or two to complete the scan.
					<br/>
					<br/>
					<br/>
					<h4>
						Output:
					</h4>
					Results are tab delimited.  If verbose mode is turned off, then only the results will show.  The example below shows verbose on.
					If you have troubles calling the command line version, you can also try "cd" 'ing into the 'macos' folder and try running the binary 
					again.  The below example shows the launch command from within the 'macos' folder.
					<br/>
					<div id="apps">
						Leela:macos aschenk$ ./App\ Scanner -p /Users/aschenk/Desktop/Offline\ Trip\ Guide.app -v YES -l 27 -u NO<br/>
						path = /Users/aschenk/Desktop/Offline Trip Guide.app<br/>
